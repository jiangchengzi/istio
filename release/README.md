## Overview

The release is started from the [istio/istio](https://github.com/istio/istio) module.

Istio release is currently composed of artifacts for the following repos:

* [auth](https://github.com/istio/auth)
* [pilot](https://github.com/istio/pilot)
* [mixer](https://github.com/istio/mixer)
* [proxy](https://github.com/istio/proxy)

The release consists in retagging the artifacts and creating new annotated tags.

Only organization members part of the [Release Engineers](https://github.com/orgs/istio/teams/release-engineers/members) team may create a release.

If you are making a release from a branch, use the branch name, e.g. `BRANCH=release-0.1` for 0.1 or `master` for master.

## Release Preparation

Before any release we need to make sure that all components are using the same
version of [istio/api](https://github.com/istio/api/commits/master).

As of today API is used in
* [pilot](https://github.com/istio/pilot/blob/master/WORKSPACE#L480)
* [mixer](https://github.com/istio/mixer/blob/master/istio_api.bzl#L18)
* [mixerclient](https://github.com/istio/mixerclient/blob/master/repositories.bzl#L379)

For mixerclient, it gets more complicated. We need to update proxy to use the
last version, and then update pilot a second time to use the last proxy.

## Semi-automated release since 0.2

The release process is semi-automated starting with release 0.2.
It is still driven from a release engineer desktop but all actions are automated
using [githubctl](https://github.com/istio/test-infra/blob/master/toolbox/githubctl/main.go),
a tool of our own that acts as a GitHub client making REST calls through the GitHub API.
One may get githubctl from the istio/test-infra repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/istio/test-infra.git
```

and build it using

```
$ bazel build //toolbox/githubctl
```

The binary output is located in bazel-bin/toolbox/githubctl/githubctl.

```
$ alias githubctl="${PWD}/bazel-bin/toolbox/githubctl/githubctl"
```

The release process goes like the following:

Step 1: Tag the release.
```
$ githubctl --token_file=<github token file> \
    --op=tagIstioDepsForRelease \
    --base_branch=<release branch or master>
```

Step 2: The previous command triggers rebuild and retagging on pilot, proxy, mixer and auth. 
 Wait for them to finish. Check build job status [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/builds?project=istio-io&organizationId=433637338589).

Step 3: Create an update PR in istio/istio.
```
$ githubctl --token_file=<github token file> \
    --op=updateIstioVersion --base_branch=<release branch or master> 
```

Step 4: Request PR approval and wait for the PR to be merged.

Step 5: Finalize the release. This creates the release in GitHub, uploads the artifacts,
 advances next release tag, and updates download script with latest release:
```
$ githubctl --token_file=<github token file> \
    --op=uploadArtifacts --base_branch=<release branch or master> \
    --next_release=0.2.2
```

```<github token file>``` is a text file containing the github peronal access token setup following the [instruction](https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/devel/README.md#setting-up-a-personal-access-token)

### Revert a failed release

When a release failed, we need to clean up partial state before retry. A common case is that a build failed when doing Step 2 from the above. We need to rollback the Step 1 by doing the following: 

1. Remove new tags on the repos by finding the release and click "delete tag".
   * https://github.com/istio/auth/releases
   * https://github.com/istio/mixer/releases
   * https://github.com/istio/pilot/releases
   * https://github.com/istio/proxy/releases
1. Proceed with the above release process step [1-5].

## Manual release process (DEPRECATED)

### Creating tags

From [istio/istio](https://github.com/istio/istio), the ```istio.VERSION``` file should look like this

        $ cat istio.VERSION
        # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE MANUALLY instead use
        # tests/updateVersion.sh (see tests/README.md)
        export CA_HUB="docker.io/istio"
        export CA_TAG="0.1.2-d773c15"
        export MIXER_HUB="docker.io/istio"
        export MIXER_TAG="0.1.2-6bfa390"
        export ISTIOCTL_URL="https://storage.googleapis.com/istio-artifacts/pilot/stable-6dbd19d/artifacts/istioctl"
        export PILOT_HUB="docker.io/istio"
        export PILOT_TAG="0.1.2-6dbd19d"

Please make sure that ISTIOCTL_URL and PILOT_TAG points to the same SHA.

The next release version is stored in ```istio.RELEASE```:

        RELEASE_TAG="$(cat istio.RELEASE)"; echo $RELEASE_TAG

The next step is to create an annotated tag for each of the repo.
Fortunately each tag above contains the short SHA at which it was built.

        PILOT_SHA=6dbd19d
        MIXER_SHA=6bfa390
        AUTH_SHA=d773c15

        $ git clone https://github.com/istio/pilot
        $ cd pilot
        $ git tag -a ${RELEASE_TAG} -m "Istio Release ${RELEASE_TAG}" ${PILOT_SHA}
        $ git push --tags origin

        $ git clone https://github.com/istio/mixer
        $ cd mixer
        $ git tag -a ${RELEASE_TAG} -m "Istio Release ${RELEASE_TAG}" ${MIXER_SHA}
        $ git push --tags origin

        $ git clone https://github.com/istio/auth
        $ cd auth
        $ git tag -a ${RELEASE_TAG} -m "Istio Release ${RELEASE_TAG}" ${AUTH_SHA}
        $ git push --tags origin

### Rebuild artifacts to include the tags

Go to Mixer [stable artifacts](https://testing.istio.io/view/All%20Jobs/job/mixer/job/stable-artifacts/)
job and click on ```Build with Parameters```.
Replace ```BRANCH_SPEC``` with the value of ```${RELEASE_TAG}```

Go to Pilot [stable artifacts](https://testing.istio.io/view/All%20Jobs/job/pilot/job/stable-artifacts/)
job and click on ```Build with Parameters```.
Replace ```BRANCH_SPEC``` with the value of ```${RELEASE_TAG}```

Go to Auth [stable artifacts](https://testing.istio.io/view/All%20Jobs/job/auth/job/stable-artifacts/)
job and click on ```Build with Parameters```.
Replace ```BRANCH_SPEC``` with the value of ```${RELEASE_TAG}```

### Updating ```istio.VERSION```

Now we need update the tags ```istio.VERSION``` to point to the release tag.

        $ git checkout -b ${USER}-${RELEASE_TAG} origin/${BRANCH}
        $ install/updateVersion.sh -p docker.io/istio,${RELEASE_TAG} \
           -c docker.io/istio,${RELEASE_TAG} -x docker.io/istio,${RELEASE_TAG} \
           -i https://storage.googleapis.com/istio-artifacts/pilot/${RELEASE_TAG}/artifacts/istioctl

Create a commit with name "Istio Release ${RELEASE_TAG}", and a PR.
Once tests are completed, merge the PR, and create an annotated tags

        $ git pull origin ${BRANCH}
        $ git tag -a ${RELEASE_TAG} -m "Istio Release ${RELEASE_TAG}" HEAD # assuming nothing else was committed
        $ git push --tags origin

### Creating archives

Sync your workspace at ${RELEASE_TAG}:

        $ git reset --hard ${RELEASE_TAG}
        $ git clean -xdf

Create the release archives

        $ ./release/create_release_archives.sh
        # On a Mac
        $ CP=gcp TAR=gtar ./release/create_release_archives.sh
        ...
        Archives are available in /tmp/istio.version.A59u/archives


Open the [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases),
and edit the release that points to ```${RELEASE_TAG}```. Uploads the artifacts created by the previous script.


### Finalizing the release

Create a PR, where you increment ```istio.RELEASE``` for the next
release and you update ```istio/downloadIstio.sh``` to point to ```${RELEASE_TAG}```
